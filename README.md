# A PHP Class for talking to Uniden scanners over UDP

**_This code is for demonstration purposes only and provided as-is with no warranty of any kind_**

For use with Uniden scanners equipped with WiFi dongles like the BCD536HP

This class is incomplete as I have only abstracted a few of the commands that can be sent to the device. However, you can still use the class to send any raw command you want with the SendCommand() function.

Uniden's documentation for this funtionality can be found here: http://info.uniden.com/twiki/pub/UnidenMan4/BCD536HPFirmwareUpdate/BCDx36HP_RemoteCommand_Specification_V1_03.pdf
